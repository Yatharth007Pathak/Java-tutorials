/*
Hereâ€™s a line-by-line breakdown of the provided Java code:

public class dt {
Defines a public class named dt. In Java, classes are templates for creating objects.

public static void main(String[] args) {
Declares the main method, which is the entry point of the Java program. 
It is public (accessible from anywhere), static (can be called without creating an instance of the class), and does not return a value (void). 
The String[] args parameter allows for command-line arguments.

int marks[] = {98, 78, 86, 45};
Declares and initializes an integer array named marks with the values 98, 78, 86, and 45. 
The size of the array is determined by the number of elements provided (4 elements in this case).

System.out.println(marks[0]);
Prints the value of the first element of the marks array (which is 98) to the console.

System.out.println(marks[1]);
Prints the value of the second element of the marks array (which is 78) to the console.

System.out.println(marks[2]);
Prints the value of the third element of the marks array (which is 86) to the console.

System.out.println(marks[3]);
Prints the value of the fourth element of the marks array (which is 45) to the console.

System.out.println(marks[4]);
This line attempts to print the value of the fifth element of the marks array (index 4). 
However, since the array only has 4 elements (index 0 to 3), 
this will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime because there is no element at index 4.

}
Closes the main method.

}
Closes the class definition.

Error Explanation:
The program will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when it tries to access marks[4] because the marks array only has indices from 0 to 3.
The array does not have a fifth element, so accessing index 4 is invalid.
