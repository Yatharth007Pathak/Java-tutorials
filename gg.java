/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided Java code, line by line:

public class gg {: This line defines a public class named gg. In Java, every application must have at least one class definition.

public static void main(String[] args) {: This is the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java application. 

int size = 5;: This line declares an integer variable named size and initializes it with the value 5. 
This variable represents the size (or dimensions) of the checkerboard pattern that will be printed.

for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++) {: This is the outer for loop, which controls the number of rows in the pattern. 
It starts with i = 1 and runs until i is less than or equal to size (i.e., 5), incrementing i by 1 in each iteration.

for (int j = 1; j <= size; j++) {: This is the inner for loop, which controls the number of columns in each row of the pattern. 
It starts with j = 1 and runs until j is less than or equal to size, incrementing j by 1 in each iteration.

if ((i + j) % 2 == 0) {: This line checks whether the sum of the current row index i and the current column index j is even. 
If the sum is even, it evaluates to true, and a star (*) will be printed at that position.

System.out.print("* ");: If the condition in the if statement is true, 
this line prints a star (*) followed by a space without moving to the next line. 
This creates the part of the checkerboard pattern where stars appear.

else {: This marks the beginning of the else block, which executes when the condition in the if statement is false 
(i.e., when the sum of i and j is odd).

System.out.print(" ");: This line prints two space characters without moving to the next line. 
This is used to fill the alternating spaces in the checkerboard pattern.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the if-else statement.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the inner for loop.

System.out.println();: This line moves the cursor to the next line after completing a row, 
allowing the next row of the checkerboard pattern to be printed.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the outer for loop.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the main method.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the class definition.
