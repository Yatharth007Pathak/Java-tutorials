public class aa {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Hare Krishna");
    }
}


/*
Explanation:
public class aa {
This line declares a public class named aa. In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, 
and public means that this class can be accessed from other classes. The class name should match the filename (i.e., aa.java).

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of any Java application. 
public means that the method is accessible from outside the class, 
static means it belongs to the class rather than instances of the class, 
void indicates that the method does not return a value, 
String[] args is a parameter that accepts an array of String objects, usually used for command-line arguments.
The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) looks for this method to start execution.

System.out.println("Hare Krishna");
This line prints the string "Hare Krishna" to the console. S
ystem.out is a built-in object in Java that represents the standard output stream, 
and println is a method that prints the specified message followed by a new line.

}
This closing brace signifies the end of the main method.

}
This closing brace signifies the end of the aa class.

/*
Java is a widely-used programming language and computing platform, developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and was originally named 'Oak'
First released in 1995, introduced "write once, run anywhere" concept with cross platform compatibility.

Here are some key aspects of Java:
Object-Oriented: Java is based on the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, 
which organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
Platform-Independent: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
making Java applications portable across many platforms, regardless of the underlying hardware architecture
Robust and Secure: Java emphasizes early checking for possible errors, runtime checking, 
and the elimination of error-prone constructs, making it a reliable and secure language.
Multithreaded: Java has built-in support for multithreaded programming(ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently), 
which allows developers to build applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
High Performance: Although Java is an interpreted language, the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) 
compilers enables high performance through adaptive optimization techniques.

Java Components
Java Development Kit (JDK): A software development environment used for developing Java applications, 
which includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), 
a documentation generator (Javadoc), a java debugger and other tools.

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Software package that provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
and other components necessary to run applications written in Java.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM): An abstract machine that enables a computer to run a Java program 
by converting Java bytecode into machine-specific code.

Common Uses
Web Applications: Java is used to create large-scale enterprise applications and web applications.
Mobile Applications: Java is the foundation for Android application development.
Desktop Applications: Java provides a strong framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications.
Enterprise Software: Many enterprise systems, such as banking systems, use Java for backend development.
Embedded Systems: Java is used in various embedded systems, such as consumer electronics.

Popular Frameworks and Libraries
Spring: A comprehensive framework for enterprise applications.
Hibernate: An ORM framework for database interactions.
Apache Struts: A framework for building web applications.
JavaFX: A platform for creating and delivering desktop applications.
