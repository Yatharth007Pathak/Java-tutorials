/*
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code line by line:

public class ei {
This declares a public class named ei. The class contains methods that define its behavior.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the main method, the entry point for the program's execution. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts the execution from this method.

ei obj = new ei();
This creates an instance (object) of the class ei named obj. Using this object, you can call non-static methods of the class.

obj.greet();
This calls the greet method using the obj instance. Since the greet method is non-static, it must be called through an object of the class.

public void greet() {
This defines a public method named greet. It doesn't return any value (void). 
It can be accessed from outside the class using an instance of the class.

System.out.println("Hello World");
This prints the text "Hello World" to the console.
