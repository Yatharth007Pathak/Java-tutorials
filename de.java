/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided Java code:

Class Declaration: public class de defines a public class named de.

Main Method: public static void main(String[] args) is the starting point of the program where execution begins.

Outer For Loop: for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) is the outer loop that controls the number of rows. 
It runs from i = 0 to i = 6 (a total of 7 iterations).

For each value of i, it controls how many stars (*) will be printed in that row.

Inner For Loop: for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) is the inner loop that runs j from 0 to i. This means:
When i = 0, it prints one star.
When i = 1, it prints two stars.

This continues until i = 6, where it prints seven stars.

Print Statement: System.out.print("*" + " "); prints a * followed by a space.
The stars are printed in the same row without moving to the next line.

New Line After Inner Loop: System.out.println(); moves the cursor to the next line after the inner loop completes.
This ensures that each row of stars is printed on a new line.
