/*
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the code line by line:

public class ep {
This declares a public class named ep. This class contains methods that define its functionality.

public void greet(String name) {
This defines a public method named greet that takes one parameter of type String called name. 
The method is non-static and has a return type of void, indicating that it does not return any value. 
This method is designed to print a greeting message.

System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
This line prints the message "Hello, " followed by the value of the name parameter to the console.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the main method, which serves as the entry point for the program. The execution of the Java application begins here.

ep obj = new ep();
This creates an instance (object) of the ep class named obj. This object will be used to call the non-static method greet.

obj.greet("Bob");
This calls the greet method on the obj instance, passing the string "Bob" as an argument. 
The method will print the greeting message using the value provided.
