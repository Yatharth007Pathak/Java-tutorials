Polymorphism allows methods to have multiple forms. It can be achieved through method overloading or overriding.
Polymorphism allows methods or objects to take many forms. It can be achieved in two ways:

Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding): Redefining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class.
