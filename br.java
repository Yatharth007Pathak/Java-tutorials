/*
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the provided Java code:

public class br {
This defines a public class named br. In Java, every program consists of at least one class, and this is where the program logic is placed.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the main method, the entry point where the program starts executing. Itâ€™s static so it can run without needing an object of the class.

int a = 20000;
Here, an integer variable a is initialized with the value 20000.

short A = (short)a;
This casts the integer a into a short data type, resulting in a variable A. The short data type can only hold values between -32,768 and 32,767. 
Since 20000 falls within this range, the cast works without losing data.

int b = 30000;
An integer variable b is initialized with the value 30000.

short B = (short)b;
This casts the integer b into a short data type, resulting in a variable B. 
Since 30000 is within the valid range for short, it works but may lose precision depending on further operations.

System.out.println("A = " + A);
This prints the value of A, which is 20000, to the console with the message "A = ".

System.out.println("B = " + B);
This prints the value of B, which is 30000. Due to casting to short, the value may be truncated to fit within the short range, 
which could result in a value like -35536 (since 30000 exceeds the limit for short).

System.out.println("A + B = " + (short)(A + B));
This adds the values of A and B, casts the result to a short, and prints it. 
Because the sum of 20000 and 30000 exceeds the short range (-32768 to 32,767), the result is truncated as a negative value due to overflow.
When a value exceeds the short range, overflow occurs. In Java, overflow wraps around within the bounds of the short data type. 
So, 50000 is wrapped around to a negative number. Specifically, 50000 - 65536 (the range of short) = -15536.

System.out.println("A + B = " + (A + B));
This adds A and B without casting the result, treating it as an int (since A + B results in an integer). It prints the correct sum of 50000.

}
This marks the end of the main method and the class definition, completing the program.
