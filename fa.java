/*
Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided code line by line:

public class fa {
This line declares a public class named fa. The class will contain methods for printing numbers.

public void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
This defines a public instance method named printNumbers that takes a variable number of integer arguments (varargs). 
The int... numbers syntax allows the method to accept any number of int values, including zero.

System.out.print("Numbers: ");
This line prints the string "Numbers: " to the console without moving to the next line. This serves as a label for the output of the numbers.

for (int number : numbers) {
This line starts a for-each loop that iterates through each integer in the numbers array. 
For each iteration, the current number is assigned to the variable number.

System.out.print(number + " ");
Inside the loop, this line prints the current number followed by a space. It will print all numbers provided as arguments in the same line.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the for-each loop.

System.out.println();
This line prints a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line after all numbers have been printed. 
It ensures that subsequent output starts on a new line.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the printNumbers method.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This is the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java application. The program execution starts here.

fa example = new fa();
This line creates a new instance of the fa class named example. This object will be used to call the printNumbers method.

example.printNumbers(1, 2, 3);
This line calls the printNumbers method on the example object, passing the integers 1, 2, and 3 as arguments. The method prints: Numbers: 1 2 3 

example.printNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
This line calls the printNumbers method again, passing the integers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as arguments. The method prints: Numbers: 4 5 6 7 8 

example.printNumbers();
This line calls the printNumbers method without any arguments. Since no numbers are provided, it prints: Numbers: 

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the main method.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the fa class.
