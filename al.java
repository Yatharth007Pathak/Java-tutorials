// Implicit conversion with characters

// A char can be implicitly converted to int, long, float, or double because char holds a Unicode value (an integer between 0 and 65,535).

/*
Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

public class al {
This line declares a public class named al. In Java, this class is a container for the code, 
and public means it can be accessed from other classes.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of the Java application. 
public allows the method to be accessed from outside the class, static means it belongs to the class rather than an instance, 
void indicates the method does not return a value, and String[] args is an array of String objects used for command-line arguments.

char charValue = 'A';
This line declares a char variable named charValue and initializes it with the character 'A'. 
The char type is used to store a single 16-bit Unicode character.

int intValue = charValue; // char to int
This line declares an int variable named intValue and initializes it with the value of charValue. 
In this case, charValue is automatically converted to its ASCII (or Unicode) integer representation. 
The comment explains that this is a conversion from char to int.

System.out.println("Char value: " + charValue);
This line prints the value of charValue prefixed with "Char value: " to the console, followed by a new line. 
It will display the character 'A'.

System.out.println("Int value (ASCII of char): " + intValue);
This line prints the value of intValue prefixed with "Int value (ASCII of char): " to the console, followed by a new line. 
It will display the integer value corresponding to the ASCII value of the character 'A' (which is 65).

}
This closing brace marks the end of the main method.

This closing brace marks the end of the al class.
