/*
for Loop:
The for loop is commonly used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. 
It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
*/

public class ch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }
    }
}
