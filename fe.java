/*
The code defines a class fe containing a main method and a static method getRandom. 
The getRandom method generates a random integer between 1 and 6 using the Math.random() function. 
The main method prints the result of the getRandom method to the console when the program is run. 
Each time the program is executed, a different random number between 1 and 6 will be displayed.

/*
Here’s a line-by-line breakdown of the provided code:

public class fe {
This line declares a public class named fe. The class encapsulates the main method and other methods.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java application. The program execution starts here.

System.out.println(getRandom());
This line calls the getRandom method and prints its return value to the console. The getRandom method is defined later in the class. 
This will display a random integer generated by the method.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the main method.

public static int getRandom() {
This line defines a public static method named getRandom that returns an integer value. 
The method can be called without creating an instance of the fe class.

return (int) (Math.random() * 6 + 1);
This line generates a random integer between 1 and 6. Here’s how it works:

Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).
Multiplying by 6 scales the random number to the range [0.0, 6.0).
Adding 1 shifts the range to [1.0, 7.0).
The (int) cast converts the floating-point result to an integer, effectively truncating the decimal part. 
This results in a final range of [1, 6] (inclusive).

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the getRandom method.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the fe class.
