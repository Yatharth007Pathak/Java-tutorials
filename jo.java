/*
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

interface Greeting {
Declares an interface named Greeting.
The Greeting interface contains one method, sayHello(), which must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.

void sayHello();
Declares an abstract method sayHello() with no implementation. 
This method is expected to be implemented by any class that implements the Greeting interface.

}
Ends the Greeting interface.

public class jo {
Declares a public class named jo, which contains the main() method.

public static void main(String[] args) {
Defines the main() method, which serves as the entry point of the program.

Greeting greet = new Greeting() {
Creates an instance of an anonymous class that implements the Greeting interface.
Since Greeting is an interface, the anonymous class must provide an implementation for the sayHello() method.

public void sayHello() {
Implements the sayHello() method from the Greeting interface inside the anonymous class.

System.out.println("Hello from an anonymous class!");
Prints "Hello from an anonymous class!" to the console when sayHello() is called.

}
Ends the sayHello() method.

};
Ends the anonymous class that implements the Greeting interface.

greet.sayHello();
Calls the sayHello() method on the greet object (the instance of the anonymous class). Outputs "Hello from an anonymous class!" to the console.

}
Ends the main() method.

}
Ends the jo class.


Summary
The code defines an interface Greeting with one method sayHello().
In the main() method, an anonymous class is used to provide an implementation of the Greeting interface without needing a separate named class.
The anonymous class implements the sayHello() method, which prints "Hello from an anonymous class!" when called.
The greet.sayHello() call outputs this message to the console.
