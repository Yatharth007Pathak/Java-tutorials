/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the provided Java code, line by line:

public class gq {: This line defines a public class named gq. In Java, every application must have at least one class definition.

public static void main(String[] args) {: This is the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java application. 

int rows = 5;: This line declares an integer variable named rows and initializes it with the value 5. 
This variable determines the number of rows that will be printed in the pattern.

int number = 1;: This line declares an integer variable named number and initializes it with 1. 
This variable will be used to print consecutive numbers in the pattern.

for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {: This is the outer for loop that iterates through each row. 
It starts with i equal to 1 and continues until i is less than or equal to rows (i.e., 5), incrementing i by 1 in each iteration.

for (int j = rows; j > i; j--) {: This is the inner for loop that handles the printing of spaces before the numbers in the current row. 
It starts with j equal to rows and continues until j is greater than i. 
This loop determines how many spaces are printed to align the numbers properly.

System.out.print(" ");: This line prints a single space for each iteration of the inner loop, 
creating the necessary indentation for the current row.

for (int k = 1; k <= i; k++) {: This is the second inner for loop that prints the numbers in the current row. 
It starts with k equal to 1 and continues until k is less than or equal to i, incrementing k by 1 in each iteration.

System.out.print(number++ + " ");: This line prints the current value of number, followed by a space. 
After printing, the value of number is incremented by 1, ensuring that consecutive numbers are printed.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the second inner for loop.

System.out.println();: This line moves the cursor to next line after completing the inner loops, allowing the next row of numbers to be printed.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the outer for loop.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the main method.

}: This closing brace marks the end of the class definition.
