/*
The code defines a class ff containing a main method and a static method getRandom. 
The getRandom method generates a random integer between two given values (a and b), with a being inclusive and b being exclusive. 
The main method calls this method with the values 10 and 20 and prints the result.

/*
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the code:

public class ff {
This line declares a public class named ff. It will contain all the methods needed for this program.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which is the entry point for the Java application. 
It is static, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

System.out.println(getRandom(10, 20));
This line calls the getRandom method, passing 10 and 20 as arguments, and prints the return value to the console.
This will display a random integer between 10 and 20.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the main method.

public static int getRandom(int a, int b) {
This line defines a public static method named getRandom that takes two integer parameters (a and b) and returns an integer value. 
The method is static, meaning it can be called without an instance of the ff class.

return (int) (Math.random() * (b - a) + a);
This line generates a random integer between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive). Here's how it works:

Math.random() generates a random floating-point number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).
Multiplying by (b - a) scales the random number to the range [0.0, b - a).
Adding a shifts the range to [a, b).
The (int) cast converts the floating-point result to an integer, 
effectively truncating the decimal part and ensuring the result falls in the range [a, b).

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the getRandom method.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the ff class.
