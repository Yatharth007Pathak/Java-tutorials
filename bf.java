/*
Here’s a pointwise breakdown of the code in a detailed manner:

import java.util.Scanner;
This line imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, enabling the program to take input from the user via the console.

public class bf {
A public class named bf is declared. In Java, all code must be inside a class, and the class name should match the filename.

public static void main(String[] args) {
The main method is where the execution of the program begins. It’s static so it can be run without creating an instance of the class. 
The String[] args is used for command-line arguments (though not utilized here).

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
A Scanner object sc is created to capture user input from the console (System.in). The Scanner object reads data from the standard input stream.

int firstNumber = sc.nextInt();
The nextInt() method of the Scanner object reads the first integer input from the user and stores it in the variable firstNumber.

int secondNumber = sc.nextInt();
Similarly, the nextInt() method is used to read another integer input from the user and store it in the variable secondNumber.

int result = firstNumber + secondNumber;
The program adds the two integers stored in firstNumber and secondNumber and stores the result in the variable result.

System.out.println(result);
This line prints the value of result (the sum of the two input integers) to the console.

sc.close();
The Scanner object is closed to free up any system resources associated with it and to avoid resource leaks.

}
This marks the end of the main method and the class.
