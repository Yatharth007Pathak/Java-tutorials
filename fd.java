/*
The code defines a class fd that contains a method getRandom, which generates and returns a random integer between 0 and 5. 
In the main method, this random integer is printed to the console. 
The use of Math.random() allows for the generation of random numbers efficiently within the specified range.

/*
Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided code line by line:

public class fd {
This line declares a public class named fd. This class contains methods related to generating random numbers.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which serves as the entry point for the Java application. The program execution starts here.

System.out.println(getRandom());
This line calls the getRandom method and prints its return value to the console. The method is expected to return a random integer.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the main method.

public static int getRandom() {
This line defines a public static method named getRandom that returns an integer value. 
The static keyword allows the method to be called without creating an instance of the class.

return (int) (Math.random() * 6);
This line generates a random number. The Math.random() method returns a double value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). 
Multiplying this value by 6 scales it to a range of 0.0 to 6.0. 
Casting the result to int truncates the decimal part, resulting in a random integer between 0 and 5 (inclusive).

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the getRandom method.

}
This closing brace indicates the end of the fd class.
