// Promotion in expressions

/*
When performing arithmetic operations involving mixed data types, 
smaller types are automatically promoted to a larger type before the operation is performed.

Byte, short, and char are promoted to int: 
Even if the operation involves smaller types like byte, short, or char, they are first promoted to int and the result is also of type int.

Mixed type expressions: 
The result of expressions involving multiple data types follows the promotion rules. 
The smaller types are promoted to the larger type in the expression.

/*
Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

public class ak {
This line declares a public class named ak. In Java, the class is a container for the code, 
and public means it is accessible from other classes.

public static void main(String[] args) {
This line defines the main method, which is the entry point of the Java application. 
public allows the method to be accessed from outside the class, static means it belongs to the class rather than an instance, 
void indicates the method does not return a value, and String[] args is an array of String objects used for command-line arguments.

byte byteValue = 42;
This line declares a byte variable named byteValue and initializes it with the value 42. The byte type is an 8-bit integer.

char charValue = 'A';
This line declares a char variable named charValue and initializes it with the character 'A'. 
The char type is used to store a single 16-bit Unicode character.

int intValue = 500;
This line declares an int variable named intValue and initializes it with the value 500. The int type is used for 32-bit integer values.

long longValue = 1000L;
This line declares a long variable named longValue and initializes it with the value 1000L. 
The L suffix indicates that the number is a long, which is a 64-bit integer.

float floatValue = 5.67f;
This line declares a float variable named floatValue and initializes it with the value 5.67f. 
The f suffix specifies that the number is a float, which is a single-precision 32-bit floating-point number.

double doubleValue = 0.1234;
This line declares a double variable named doubleValue and initializes it with the value 0.1234. 
The double type is a double-precision 64-bit floating-point number.

// The byte is converted to int
This is a comment explaining that in the following operation, the byte value is automatically promoted to int.

int result1 = byteValue + intValue;
This line performs an addition of byteValue and intValue. 
Since byteValue is promoted to int, the result of the addition is also an int and stored in result1.

// The char is converted to int, then int to long
This is a comment explaining that in the following operation, the char value is first promoted to int and then to long.

long result2 = charValue + longValue;
This line performs an addition of charValue and longValue. 
charValue is promoted to int and then the result is promoted to long. The result is stored in result2.

// The int is converted to float
This is a comment explaining that in the following operation, the int value is promoted to float.

float result3 = intValue + floatValue;
This line performs an addition of intValue and floatValue. intValue is promoted to float, and the result of the addition is stored in result3.

// The float is converted to double
This is a comment explaining that in the following operation, the float value is promoted to double.

double result4 = floatValue * doubleValue;
This line performs a multiplication of floatValue and doubleValue. 
floatValue is promoted to double, and the result of the multiplication is stored in result4.

System.out.println("Result 1 (int + byte): " + result1);
This line prints the value of result1 prefixed with "Result 1 (int + byte): " to the console, followed by a new line.

System.out.println("Result 2 (char + long): " + result2);
This line prints the value of result2 prefixed with "Result 2 (char + long): " to the console, followed by a new line.

System.out.println("Result 3 (int + float): " + result3);
This line prints the value of result3 prefixed with "Result 3 (int + float): " to the console, followed by a new line.

System.out.println("Result 4 (float * double): " + result4);
This line prints the value of result4 prefixed with "Result 4 (float * double): " to the console, followed by a new line.
